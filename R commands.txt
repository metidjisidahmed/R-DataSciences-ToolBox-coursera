-----------------------Repositories & packages ----------------------------
the R packages are found in one of these big 3 reposirories :
CRAN/GitHub/BioConductor
				Exploring Packages ( to know which package you will need )  :
 for CRAN : the topics of packages are  divided in 35 themes in CRAN Task Views 
 there are also RDocumentation to search for any package in the 3 repositories ( it has two the themes brwoser )
				 how to install a package :
1-FOR CRAN :
	Run these two commands in the R console:
		to install one package : 'install.packages("ggplot2")'
		or for multiple packages : 'install.packages.(c("ggplot2" , "devtools", "lme4"))'
	PS ;  the c() represents a vector 
	or in RStudio going to Tools->Install Packages 
2-FOR Bioconductor :
	Run these three commands :
		source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") // to make the 'bioclite()' available which is used to instal bioconductor
		bioclite() // install the bioconductor
		bioclite("GenomicFeatures") // install a R package 
3- FOR Github :
	Run these commands :
		install.packages("devtools") // install the package 'devtools' , the package which allows us to execute 'install_github' ( execute it once just to install the package in my machine )
		library(devtools) // the library function is used to load the package installe dinto our code ( its equivalent to #include in C or import in Js ), so we are here importing the devtools package into our R code
		install_github("author/package") // to install a specific repo
		
or in RStudio going to Tools->Install Packages 


			How to load a Package :
1- usning the library function 'library()'
2- in the RStudio Interface going to the Bottom-right section-> Packages-> check the package i need to use 

			To know which packages i have in my machine ( installed packages ) :
Run 'library()'
			Update package :
to update all the packaes : Run 'update.packages()'
to update a specific package you just need to reinstall it : 'install.packages("ggplot2")'
or in RStudio interface : bottom-left section ->packages->update
			To unload a package:
Run : detach ( "package:ggplot2" , unload=TRUE)
or in RStudio interface : bottom-left section ->packages->uncheck the package 
			to remove ( unistall ) a package :
Run remove.packages("ggplot2")
or in RStudio interface : bottom-left section ->packages->click in the 'X' associated to  the package 
			to get manual of use ( help ) of a specific package :
run : help( package="ggplot2")
or in RStudio interface : bottom-left section ->packages->click inthe name of the package
			to get extended help in a specific package :
run : "browseVignettes('ggplot2')" 


----------------------R markdown -----------------------------
the r markdown files can be stored in form of HTML/Word/Pdf
we have to install first the rmarkdown package : install.packages("rmarkdown") 
in the top of R documents we should have a header which describes our file : 
---
title : 
author:
date : 'Today'
output :
--- 

'-'+space+'content'+2 spaces <=> list
**content** <=> Bold
*content* <=> italic
[link]content <=> link
`code` <=> content in form of code inline  
```
lines of codes <=> lines of codes in form of block
```
~~content~~ <=> strike through the content
# content <=> title level 1
## content <=> title level 2
### content <=> title level 3
